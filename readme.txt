This is the website project for CS460. As stated before in the report. There is not additional assumption other than what I have written on the previous report. The website has all the functionality as required in the problem assginment. However, the website is not secure there is potential to be compromised by the cyber attack. Included in this file is some basic html tamplates and the major python file that runs all the service and a database schema that support the database construction. In addtional the environment building is relatively simple, just build the right path for mysql and flask and change the path in line 27 of the app.py as the local destination to store the cached images, you are ready to go, which means the images are stored on local file system of yours and what in the database is just a name used to display the picture on the website.
